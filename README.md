# Game of Life

Welcome to my first project, the Game of Life! This project is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Jimmy Shum, a passionate developer who loves creating interactive and engaging web applications. This is my first project, and I'm excited to share it with you. 

## About the Project

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic and interactivity.

## Features

- **Grid Display**: A grid of cells that can be alive or dead.
- **Game Rules**: Implementation of the four rules of the Game of Life.
- **Interactivity**: Users can click on cells to toggle their state (alive/dead).
- **Animation**: The game evolves automatically, showing the changes in the grid over time.
- **Color Theme**: The UI can change color themes for a customized look.
- **Specific Patterns**: Predefined patterns can be inserted into the game.
- **Evolution Speed**: The speed of the game's evolution can be adjusted.
- **Evolution Condition**: The conditions for the game's evolution can be changed.

## How to Play

1. **Set Initial State**: Click on the cells in the grid to set their initial state (alive or dead).
2. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
3. **Observe**: Watch as the cells evolve according to the rules of the Game of Life.
4. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.
